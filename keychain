Description:

 Keychain is an OpenSSH key manager, typically run from ~/.bash_profile.  When
 run, it will make sure ssh-agent is running; if not, it will start ssh-agent.
 It will redirect ssh-agent's output to ~/.ssh-agent, so that cron jobs that
 need to use ssh-agent keys can simply source this file and make the necessary
 passwordless ssh connections.  In addition, when keychain runs, it will check
 with ssh-agent and make sure that the ssh RSA/DSA keys that you specified on
 the keychain command line have actually been added to ssh-agent.  If not, you
 are prompted for the appropriate passphrases so that they can be added by
 keychain.

 Typically, one uses keychain by adding the following to the top of their
 ~/.bash_profile:

EOHELP
echo -e "  ${CYAN}keychain ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_dsa"
echo -e "  source ~/.ssh-agent${OFF}"
echo
cat <<EOHELP
 Keychain allows all your apps and cron jobs to use a single ssh-agent process
 as an authentication agent.  By default, the ssh-agent started by keychain is
 long-running and will continue to run, even after you have logged out from the
 system.  If you'd like to tighten up security a bit, take a look at the
EOHELP
echo -e " ${GREEN}--clear${OFF} option, described below."
echo
echo Options:
echo   
echo -e " ${GREEN}--clear${OFF}"
echo
cat <<EOHELP
 Tells keychain to delete all of ssh-agent's host keys.  Typically, This is
 used in the ~/.bash_profile.  The theory behind this is that keychain should
 assume that you are an intruder until proven otherwise.  However, while this
 option increases security, it still allows your cron jobs to use your ssh keys
 when you're logged out.
EOHELP
echo
echo -e " ${GREEN}--noask${OFF}"
echo
cat <<EOHELP
 This option tells keychain do everything it normally does (ensure ssh-agent is
 running, set up the ~/.ssh-agent file) except that it will not prompt you to
 add any of the keys you specified if they haven't yet been added to ssh-agent.
