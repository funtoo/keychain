=head1 NAME

keychain - re-use ssh-agent and/or gpg-agent between logins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<keychain [ -hkQqV ] [ --clear --help --ignore-missing --noask>
S<--nocolor --nogui --nolock --stop --quick --quiet --version ]>
S<[ --agents I<list> ] [ --attempts I<num> ] [ --dir I<dirname> ]>
S<[ --host I<name> ] [ --lockwait I<seconds> ]>
S<[ --timeout I<minutes> ] [ keys... ]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

keychain is a manager for ssh-agent, typically run from
~/.bash_profile.  It allows your shells and cron jobs to share a
single ssh-agent process.  By default, the ssh-agent started by
keychain is long-running and will continue to run, even after you have
logged out from the system.  If you want to change this behavior, take
a look at the --clear and --timeout options, described below.

When keychain is run, it checks for a running ssh-agent, otherwise it
starts one.  It saves the ssh-agent environment variables to
~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh, so that subsequent logins and
non-interactive shells such as cron jobs can source the file and make
passwordless ssh connections.  In addition, when keychain runs, it
verifies that the key files specified on the command-line are known to
ssh-agent, otherwise it loads them, prompting you for a password if
necessary.

Keychain also supports gpg-agent.  It does not track keys since that
ability is not available in current versions of gpg-agent.  It simply
will start gpg-agent and make it available to following logins.

keychain supports most UNIX-like operating systems, including Cygwin.
It works with both Bourne-compatible and csh-compatible shells.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--agents> I<list>

Start the agents listed.  By default keychain will build the list
automatically based on the existence of ssh-agent and/or gpg-agent on
the system.  The list should be comma-separated, for example "gpg,ssh"

=item B<--attempts> I<num>

Try num times to add keys before giving up.  The default is 3.

=item B<--clear>

Delete all of ssh-agent's keys.  Typically this is used in
.bash_profile.  The theory behind this is that keychain should assume
that you are an intruder until proven otherwise.  However, while this
option increases security, it still allows your cron jobs to use your
ssh keys when you're logged out.

=item B<--dir> I<dirname>

Keychain will use dirname rather than $HOME/.keychain

=item B<-h --help>

Show help that looks remarkably like this man-page.

=item B<--host> I<name>

Set alternate hostname for creation of pidfiles

=item B<--ignore-missing>

Don't warn if some keys on the command-line can't be found.  This is
useful for situations where you have a shared .bash_profile, but your
keys might not be available on every machine where keychain is run.

=item B<--lockwait> I<seconds>

How long to wait for the lock to become available.  Defaults to 30
seconds.

=item B<--noask>

This option tells keychain do everything it normally does (ensure
ssh-agent is running, set up the ~/.keychain/[hostname]-{c}sh files)
except that it will not prompt you to add any of the keys you
specified if they haven't yet been added to ssh-agent.

=item B<--nocolor>

Disable color hilighting for non ANSI-compatible terms.

=item B<--nogui>

Don't honor SSH_ASKPASS, if it is set.  This will cause ssh-add to
prompt on the terminal instead of using a graphical program.

=item B<--nolock>

Don't attempt to use a lockfile while manipulating files, pids and
keys.

=item B<-k --stop>

Stop all running ssh-agent processes.

=item B<-Q --quick>

If an ssh-agent process is running then use it.  Don't verify the list
of keys, other than making sure it's non-empty.  This option avoids
locking when possible so that multiple terminals can be opened
simultaneously without waiting on each other.

=item B<-q --quiet>

Only print messages in case of warning, error or required
interactivity.

=item B<--timeout> I<minutes>

Set a timeout in minutes on your keys.  This is conveyed to ssh-agent
which does the actual timing out of keys since keychain doesn't run
continuously.

=item B<-V --version>

Show version information.

=head1 EXAMPLES

This snippet would work in .bash_profile (for bash) or .zlogin (for zsh):

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa
	[[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh ]] && \
		source $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh
	[[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg ]] && \
		source  $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg

For other Bourne-compatible shells such as sh, you can use this in
.profile:

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa
	host=`uname -n`
	[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$host-sh ] && \
		. $HOME/.keychain/$host-sh
	[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$host-sh-gpg ] && \
		. $HOME/.keychain/$host-sh-gpg

This snippet would work in .login for tcsh:

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa
	if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$HOST-csh) then
		source $HOME/.keychain/$HOST-csh
	endif
	if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$HOST-csh-gpg) then
		source $HOME/.keychain/$HOST-csh-gpg
	endif

This snippet would work in .login for csh:

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa
	host=`uname -n`
	if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh) then
		source $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh
	endif
	if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh-gpg) then
		source $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh-gpg
	endif
