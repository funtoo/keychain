S<[ --stop I<which> ] [ --timeout I<minutes> ] [ keys... ]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

keychain is a manager for ssh-agent, typically run from
~/.bash_profile.  It allows your shells and cron jobs to share a
single ssh-agent process.  By default, the ssh-agent started by
keychain is long-running and will continue to run, even after you have
logged out from the system.  If you want to change this behavior, take
a look at the --clear and --timeout options, described below.

When keychain is run, it checks for a running ssh-agent, otherwise it
starts one.  It saves the ssh-agent environment variables to
~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh, so that subsequent logins and
non-interactive shells such as cron jobs can source the file and make
passwordless ssh connections.  In addition, when keychain runs, it
verifies that the key files specified on the command-line are known to
ssh-agent, otherwise it loads them, prompting you for a password if
necessary.

Keychain also supports gpg-agent in the same ways that ssh-agent is
supported.  By default keychain attempts to start all available agents
but will fall back to only gpg-agent or only ssh-agent if either is
unavailable.  You can specifically limit keychain using the --agents
option.

keychain supports most UNIX-like operating systems, including Cygwin.
It works with Bourne-compatible, csh-compatible and fish shells.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--agents> I<list>

Start the agents listed.  By default keychain will build the list
automatically based on the existence of ssh-agent and/or gpg-agent on
the system.  The list should be comma-separated, for example "gpg,ssh"

=item B<--attempts> I<num>

Try num times to add keys before giving up.  The default is 1.

=item B<--clear>

Delete all of ssh-agent's keys.  Typically this is used in
.bash_profile.  The theory behind this is that keychain should assume
that you are an intruder until proven otherwise.  However, while this
option increases security, it still allows your cron jobs to use your
ssh keys when you're logged out.

=item B<--confirm>

Keys are subject to interactive confirmation by the SSH_ASKPASS
program before being used for authentication.  See the -c option for
ssh-add(1).

=item B<--dir> I<dirname>

Keychain will use dirname rather than $HOME/.keychain

=item B<--eval>

Keychain will print lines to be evaluated in the shell on stdout.  It
respects the SHELL environment variable to determine if Bourne shell
or C shell output is expected.

=item B<--env> I<filename>

After parsing options, keychain will load additional environment
settings from "filename".  By default, if "--env" is not given, then
keychain will attempt to load from ~/.keychain/[hostname]-env or
alternatively ~/.keychain/env.  The purpose of this file is to
override settings such as PATH, in case ssh is stored in
a non-standard place.

=item B<-h --help>

Show help that looks remarkably like this man-page.

=item B<--host> I<name>

Set alternate hostname for creation of pidfiles

=item B<--ignore-missing>

Don't warn if some keys on the command-line can't be found.  This is
useful for situations where you have a shared .bash_profile, but your
keys might not be available on every machine where keychain is run.

=item B<--inherit> I<which>

Attempt to inherit agent variables from the environment.  This can be
useful in a variety of circumstances, for example when ssh-agent is
started by gdm.  The following values are valid for "which":

=over 12

=item B<local>

Inherit when a pid (e.g. SSH_AGENT_PID) is set in the environment.
This disallows inheriting a forwarded agent.

=item B<any>

Inherit when a sock (e.g. SSH_AUTH_SOCK) is set in the environment.
This allows inheriting a forwarded agent.

=item B<local-once>

Same as "local", but only inherit if keychain isn't already providing
an agent.

=item B<any-once>

Same as "any", but only inherit if keychain isn't already providing an
agent.

=back

By default, keychain-2.5.0 and later will behave as if "--inherit
local-once" is specified.  You should specify "--noinherit" if you
want the older behavior.

=item B<--lockwait> I<seconds>

How long to wait for the lock to become available.  Defaults to 30
seconds.  Zero indicates to wait forever.

=item B<--noask>

This option tells keychain do everything it normally does (ensure
ssh-agent is running, set up the ~/.keychain/[hostname]-{c}sh files)
except that it will not prompt you to add any of the keys you
specified if they haven't yet been added to ssh-agent.

=item B<--nocolor>

Disable color hilighting for non ANSI-compatible terms.

=item B<--nogui>

Don't honor SSH_ASKPASS, if it is set.  This will cause ssh-add to
prompt on the terminal instead of using a graphical program.

=item B<--noinherit>

Don't inherit any agent processes, overriding the default 
"--inherit local-once"

=item B<--nolock>

Don't attempt to use a lockfile while manipulating files, pids and
keys.

=item B<-k --stop> I<which>

Kill currently running agent processes.  The following values are
valid for "which":

=over 9

=item all

Kill all agent processes and quit keychain immediately.  Prior to
keychain-2.5.0, this was the behavior of the bare "--stop" option.

=item others

Kill agent processes other than the one keychain is providing.  Prior
to keychain-2.5.0, keychain would do this automatically.  The new
behavior requires that you specify it explicitly if you want it.

=item mine

Kill keychain's agent processes, leaving other agents alone.

=back

=item B<-Q --quick>

If an ssh-agent process is running then use it.  Don't verify the list
of keys, other than making sure it's non-empty.  This option avoids
locking when possible so that multiple terminals can be opened
simultaneously without waiting on each other.

=item B<-q --quiet>

Only print messages in case of warning, error or required
interactivity.

=item B<--timeout> I<minutes>

Set a timeout in minutes on your keys.  This is conveyed to ssh-agent
which does the actual timing out of keys since keychain doesn't run
continuously.

=item B<-V --version>

Show version information.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

This snippet should work in any shell to load two ssh keys and one gpg
key:

    eval `keychain --eval id_rsa id_dsa 0123ABCD`

If you have trouble with that in csh:

    setenv SHELL /bin/csh
    eval `keychain --eval id_rsa id_dsa 0123ABCD`

This is equivalent for Bourne shells (including bash and zsh) but
doesn't use keychain's --eval feature:

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa 0123ABCD
    [ -z "$HOSTNAME" ] && HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
    [ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh ] && \
	    . $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh
    [ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg ] && \
	    . $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg

This is equivalent for C shell (including tcsh):

    keychain id_rsa id_dsa 0123ABCD
    host=`uname -n`
    if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh) then
	    source $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh
    endif
    if (-f $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh-gpg) then
	    source $HOME/.keychain/$host-csh-gpg
    endif

To load keychain variables from a script (for example from cron) and
abort unless id_dsa is available:

    # Load keychain variables and check for id_dsa
    [ -z "$HOSTNAME" ] && HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
    . $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh 2>/dev/null
    ssh-add -l 2>/dev/null | grep -q id_dsa || exit 1
