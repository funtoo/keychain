RELEASE NOTES (See "ChangeLog" for more info):

Keychain 2.4.3 fixes a problem on BSD where multiple agents would be
started.

Keychain 2.4.2.1 fixes some minor issues in the test for existing gpg
keys.

Keychain 2.4.2 has complete support for gpg-agent, including adding
keys, clearing the agent, etc.  The default for --attempts was changed
from 3 to 1.

Keychain 2.4.1 enables Sun SSH compatibility and fixes some more
Solaris awk problems.

Keychain 2.4.0 fixes a problem with awk on Solaris, a problem with
commercial ssh not prompting for a password, and adds gpg-agent
support.

Keychain 2.3.5 fixes a minor problem where keychain would report the
wrong number of keys when adding them to ssh-agent

Keychain 2.3.4 fixes a problem where keychain would mistake defunct
ssh-agent processes for running ones

Keychain 2.3.3 fixes a problem in the help output, makes --dir work
correctly, correctly handles spaces in file and directory names, and
fixes operation on HP-UX with older OpenSSH

Keychain 2.3.2 fixes a problem involving ssh-askpass where keychain
would attempt to use the gui even when --nogui is specified

Keychain 2.3.1 fixes a problem when users are running csh, at least on
Solaris and BSD.

Keychain 2.3.0 updates the locking code to obviate the procmail
dependency

Keychain 2.2.2 fixes the generation of the -csh file, reported by Jens
Svalgaard Kohrt in http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49813

Keychain 2.2.1 includes a fix for Solaris, which cuts off ps -u output
at 8 characters.  Reported by and tested by Clay England.

Keychain 2.2.0 is a complete rewrite with a lot of compatibility and
speed fixes.  Additionally it provides --timeout for carpaski and
others interested in this feature.

Keychain 2.0.3 contains some fixes for color issues and a grep -i option for
cygwin.  

Keychain 2.0.2 contains a fix for the handling of ssh-askpass; SSH_ASKPASS now
needs to be set to enable askpass functionality.

Keychain 2.0.1 contains Solaris, Tru64 and MacOS X fixes, "--help" fixes, and
compatibility with x11-ssh-askpass.

Keychain 2.0 contains HP-UX and Cygwin fixes (Cygwin support is now inside the
main keychain script), and now stores keychain files in the ~/.keychain/
directory for tidiness. New filenames too: ~/.keychain/sh-${HOSTNAME} and
~/.keychain/csh-${HOSTNAME}. Keychain 2.0 also contains a bunch of additional
fixes and performance improvements, and the --local option has been
depreciated. Added the --dir option so that you can specify an alternate
location for keychain to look for the .keychain directory: "keychain --dir
/var/foo /path/to/my/key" will cause keychain to look for /var/foo/.keychain.

Keychain 1.9 contains fixed Solaris support and a new "keychain.cygwin" script
for Cygwin systems.  Sorry for the long delay in releasing this one; I've been
busy :)

Keychain 1.8 contains many shell compatibility improvements and various other
fixes, improved "lockfile" settings, improved detection of failed passphrase
attempts, the new ability to query public keys if the private key doesn't
contain a fingerprint, a quiet mode fix, and a new "--local" option for non-NFS
users who don't want to have the hostname appended to keychain's dot files.

Keychain 1.7 will use procmail's lockfile command if available to serialize the
startup of multiple keychain processes; this is a good thing if you have
multiple xterms opening simultaneously when you start X.  This new feature
prevents multiple instances of ssh-agent from mistakenly being started.  To
enable this feature, install procmail on your system.  We also now have a
ssh-agent kill fix, a Solaris output fix, Darwin/MacOS X fix, FreeBSD output
fix, new short-style options (-k/-h for --stop and --help), and a new
--quiet/-q option for less-verbose output.

Keychain 1.6 will now try to add multiple keys at once, so that if you have
two keys with the same passphrase, you only need to type in the passphrase
once.  Also contains a /usr/ucb Solaris path compatibility fix.

Keychain 1.5 contains a number of shell compatibility fixes for Solaris, IRIX,
and various other cleanups and optimizations.  If we are not universally sh-
compatible at this point, we are extremely close.

Keychain 1.4 *should* now be compatible with Linux, BSD, Solaris, IRIX and
hopefully many other POSIX-like environments.  Please submit any compatibility
patches to Daniel Robbins at drobbins@gentoo.org.

Keychain 1.3 and above now create ~/.ssh-agent-[hostname] files, making
KeyChain compatible with NFS-mounted home directories.  There is also a new
~/.ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] available that can be sourced by csh-based shells.

REQUIREMENTS

Keychain 1.3 and above should now be sh-compliant. Colorization features may
look weird if you're not using a vt100-compatible terminal and can be disabled
with the --nocolor option.  You can make keychain less verbose by using the -q
or --quiet option.

INSTALLATION

To install keychain, simply use the "install" command as follows:

install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain

Keychain is now installed.  Now, type "keychain --help | less -r" for
instructions on how to use keychain.  You'll find intructions for modifying
your ~/.bash_profile under the "Description" section.  For more detailed
