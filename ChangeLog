  27 Oct 2001; Brian Wellington (bwelling@xbill.org)
  A "quiet mode" (--quiet) fix; I missed an "echo".
  
  27 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org)
  Missed another "kill -9"; it's now gone.

* keychain 1.7 (21 Oct 2001) 
 
  21 Oct 2001; Frederic Gobry (frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch)
  Frederic suggested using procmail's lockfile to serialize the
  execution of critical parts of keychain, thus avoiding multiple
  ssh-agent processes being started if you happen to have multiple
  xterms open automatically when you log in.  Initially, I didn't
  think I could add this, since systems may not have the lockfile
  command; however, keychain will now auto-detect whether lockfile
  is installed; if it is, keychain will automatically use it, thus
  preventing multiple ssh-agent processes from being spawned. 
  
  21 Oct 2001; Raymond Wu (ursus@usa.net):
  --nocolor test is no longer inside the test for whether "echo -e"
  works.  According to Raymond, this works optimally on his Solaris
  box.
  
  21 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org):
  No longer "kill -9" our ssh-agent processes. SIGTERM should be 
  sufficient and will allow ssh-agent to clean up after itself 
  (this reverses a previously-applied patch).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no):
  Added argument "--quiet | -q" to make the program less 
  intrusive to the user; with it, only error and interactive 
  messages will appear.
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no):
  Changed the format of some arguments to bring them more in
  line with common *nix programs: added "-h" as alias for "--help";
  added "-k" as alias for "--stop"

  21 Oct 2001; Mark Stosberg (mark@summersault.com):
  $pidf to "$pidf" fixes to allow keychain to work with paths that
  include spaces (for Darwin and MacOS X in particular).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Jonathan Wakely (redi@redi.uklinux.net):
  Small patch to convert "echo -n -e" to "echo -e "\c"" for FreeBSD
  compatibility.

* keychain 1.6 (15 Oct 2001)

  13 Oct 2001; Ralf Horstmann (ralf.horstmann@webwasher.com):
  Add /usr/ucb to path for Solaris systems.
  
  11 Oct 2001; Idea from Joe Reid (jreid@vnet.net):
  Try to add multiple keys using ssh-add; avoid typing in identical
  passphrases more than once.  Good idea!

*keychain 1.5 (21 Sep 2001)

  21 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com):
  misc. compatibility, signal handling, cleanup fixes
  
  21 Sep 2001; 
  "ps" test to find the right one for your OS.

  20 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  "grep [s]sh-agent" to "grep [s]sh-agent" (zsh fix)

*keychain 1.4 (20 Sep 2001)

  20 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com):
  "touch $foo" to ">$foo" optimization and other "don't fork" fixes.
  Converted ${foo#--} to a case statement for Solaris sh compatibility.

  20 Sep 2001;
  Try an alternate "ps" syntax if our default one fails.  This should
  give us Solaris and IRIX (sysV) compatibility without breaking BSD.

  20 Sep 2001; Hans Peter Verne (h.p.verne@usit.uio.no);
  "echo -e" to "echo $E" (for IRIX compatibility with --nocolor),
  optimization of grep ("grep [s]sh-agent")
  
  17 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  Various fixes: trap signal 2 if signal INT not supported (NetBSD);
  handle invalid keys correctly; ancient version of ash didn't support ~,
  so using $HOME; correct zsh instruction; minor cleanups

*keychain 1.3 (12 Sep 2001)
  
  12 Sep 2001;
  Minor color changes; the cyan was hard to read on xterm-colored
  terms so it was switched to bold.  Additional --help text added.
  
  10 Sep 2001;
  We now use .ssh-agent-[hostname] instead of .ssh-agent.
  We now create a .ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] file that can be sourced
  by csh-compatible shells.  We also now kill all our existing 
  ssh-agent processes before starting a new one.

  10 Sep 2001; Robert R. Wal (rrw@hell.pl):
  Very nice NFS fixes, colorization fixes, tcsh redirect -> grep -v
  fix.  Thanks go out to others who sent me similar patches.

  10 Sep 2001; Johann Visagie (johann@egenetics.com):
  "source" to "." shell-compatibility fixes.  Thanks for the FreeBSD
  port.

  10 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  rm -f $pidf after stopping ssh-agent fix

*keychain 1.2 

  09 Sep 2001; README updates to reflect new changes.
  
  09 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  bash 1/zsh/sh compatibility; now only tries to kill *your*
  ssh-agent processes, version fix, .ssh-agent file creation error 
  detection.  Thanks! 

*keychain 1.1; fixes for calling "pidof"; README; ChangeLog

  07 Sep 2001;
  Addition of README stating that keychain requires bash 2.0 or greater,
  as well as quick install directions and web URL.

  07 Sep 2001;
  Explicitly added /sbin and /usr/sbin to path, and then called "pidof".
  I think that this is a bit more robust.
  
  06 Sep 2001; from John Ellson (ellson@lucent.com): 
  "pidof" changed to "/sbin/pidof", since it's probably not in $PATH
 
  06 Sep 2001;
  New ChangeLog! :)

*keychain 1.0; initial release (Aug 2001)
