* keychain 2.6.3 (07 Sep 2006)

  07 Sep 2006; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Support fish: http://roo.no-ip.org/fish/
  Thanks to Ilkka Poutanen for the patch.

* keychain 2.6.2 (20 Mar 2006)

  20 Mar 2006; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Add --confirm option and corresponding regression tests for Debian bug 296382.
  Thanks to Liyang HU for the patch.  Also add initialization for $ssh_timeout
  which was being inherited from the environment and add regression tests for
  --timeout

* keychain 2.6.1 (10 Oct 2005)

  10 Oct 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Change "unset evalopt" to "evalopt=false" and run through *all* the regression
  tests instead of just the new ones.  *sigh*

* keychain 2.6.0 (10 Oct 2005)

  10 Oct 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Add the --eval option which makes keychain startup easier.  See the man-page
  for examples.  Get rid of the release notes from README, so now this file is
  where changes are tracked.

* keychain 2.5.5 (28 Jul 2005)

  28 Jul 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Add the --env option and automatic reading of .keychain/env.  This allows
  variables such as PATH to be overridden for peculiar environments

* keychain 2.5.4.1 (11 May 2005)

  11 May 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  A minor bug in 2.5.4 resulted in always exiting with non-zero status.  Change
  back to the correct behavior of zero for success, non-zero for failure

* keychain 2.5.4 (11 May 2005)

  11 May 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 92316: If any locale variables are set, override them with LC_ALL=C.
  This fixes a multibyte issue with awk that could keep a running ssh-agent from
  being found.
  Fix bug 87340: Use files instead of symlinks for locking, since symlink
  creation is not atomic on cygwin.

* keychain 2.5.3.1 (10 Mar 2005)

  10 Mar 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix problem introduced in 2.5.3 wrt adding gpg keys to the agent.  Thanks
  to Azarah for spotting it.

* keychain 2.5.3 (09 Mar 2005)

  09 Mar 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Improve handling of DISPLAY by unsetting if blank.  Call gpg with
  --use-agent explicitly.

* keychain 2.5.2 (06 Mar 2005)

  06 Mar 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 78974 "keychain errors on Big/IP (x86 BSD variant)" by refraining
  from using ! in conditional expressions.  Fix RSA fingerprint extraction
  on Solaris, reported in email by Travis Fitch.  Use $HOSTNAME when
  possible instead of calling uname -n to improve bash_profile
  compatibility.

* keychain 2.5.1 (12 Jan 2005)

  12 Jan 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Don't accidentally inherit a forwarded agent when
  inheritwhich=local-once.  Move the --stop warning after the version
  splash.

* keychain 2.5.0 (07 Jan 2005)

  07 Jan 2005; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Add inheritance support via --inherit.  Add parameters to --stop for
  more control.  Change the default behavior of keychain to inherit if
  there's no keychain agent running ("--inherit local-once"), and
  refrain from killing other agents unless "--stop others" is
  specified.

* keychain 2.4.3 (17 Nov 2004)

  17 Nov 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 69879: Update findpids to work again on BSD; it has been
  broken since the changes in version 2.4.2.  Now we use OSTYPE (bash)
  or uname to determine the system type and call ps appropriately.

* keychain 2.4.2.1 (30 Sep 2004)

  30 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix minor issues in the test for existing gpg keys wrt DISPLAY

* keychain 2.4.2 (29 Sep 2004)

  29 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Make gpg support more complete.  Allow adding keys, clearing the
  agent, etc.  Fix --quick support to work properly again; it was
  broken since 2.4.0.  Change default --attempts to 1 since the progs
  ask multiple times anyway.

* keychain 2.4.1 (22 Sep 2004)

  22 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bugs 64174 and 64178; support Sun SSH, which is really OpenSSH
  in disguise and a few critical outputs changed.  Thanks to Nathan
  Bardsley for lots of help debugging on Solaris 9

  15 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix pod2man output so it formats properly on SGI systems.  Thanks to
  Matthew Moore for reporting the problem.

* keychain 2.4.0 (09 Sep 2004)

  09 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 26970 with first pass at gpg-agent support

  Fix Debian bug 269722; don't filter output of ssh-add

  Fix bug reported by Marko Myllynen regarding keychain and Solaris
  awk's inability to process -F'[ :]'

  Fix bug in now_seconds calculation, noticed by me.

* keychain 2.3.5 (28 Jul 2004)

  28 Jul 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 58623 with patch from Daniel Westermann-Clark; don't put an
  extra newline in the output of listmissing

  Generate keychain.spec from keychain.spec.in automatically so that
  the version can be set appropriately.

* keychain 2.3.4 (24 Jul 2004)

  24 Jul 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 28599 reported by Bruno Pelaia; ignore defunct processes in
  ps output

* keychain 2.3.3 (30 Jun 2004)

  30 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug reported by Matthew S. Moore in email; escape the backticks
  in --help output

  Fix bug reported by Herbie Ong in email; set pidf, cshpidf and lockf
  variables after parsing command-line to honor --dir setting

  Fix bug reported by Stephan Stahl in email; make spaces in filenames
  work throughout keychain, even in pure Bourne shell

  Fix operation on HP-UX with older OpenSSH by interpreting output of
  ssh-add as well as the error status

* keychain 2.3.2 (16 Jun 2004)

  16 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 53837 (keychain needs ssh-askpass) by unsetting SSH_ASKPASS
  when --nogui is specified

* keychain 2.3.1 (03 Jun 2004)

  03 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Fix bug 52874: problems when the user is running csh

* keychain 2.3.0 (14 May 2004)

  14 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Rewrite the locking code to avoid procmail

* keychain 2.2.2 (03 May 2004)

  03 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Call loadagent prior to generating HOSTNAME-csh file so that
  variables are set.

* keychain 2.2.1 (27 Apr 2004)

  27 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Find running ssh-agent processes by searching for /[s]sh-agen/
  instead of /[s]sh-agent/ for the sake of Solaris, which cuts off ps
  -u output at 8 characters.  Thanks to Clay England for reporting the
  problem and testing the fix.

* keychain 2.2.0 (21 Apr 2004)

  21 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:
  Rewrote most of the code, organized into functions, fixed speed
  issues involving ps, fixed compatibility issues for various UNIXes,
  hopefully didn't introduce too many bugs.  This version has a
  --quick option (for me) and a --timeout option (for carpaski).

  Also added a Makefile and converted the man-page to pod for easier
  editing.  See perlpod(1) for information on the format.  Note that
  the pod is sucked into keychain and colorized when you run make.

* keychain 2.0.3 (06 Apr 2003)

  06 Apr 2003; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org>:
  Added keychain man page, fixed bugs with displaying colors for keychain 
  --help.  Also added a $grepopts to fix the grepping for a pid on cygwin
  Also added a TODO document
  color fix based on submission by Luke Holden <email@alterself.org>

* keychain 2.0.2 (26 Aug 2002)

  26 Aug 2002; the Tru64 fix didn't work; it was being caused by "trap - foo"
  rather than "tail +2 -". Now really fixed.

  26 Aug 2002; fixed "ssh-add" call to only redirect stdin (thus enabling
  ssh-askpass) if ssh_askpass happens to be set; this is to work around a bug
  in openssh were redirecting stdin will enable ssh-askpass even if ssh_askpass
  isn't set, which contradicts the openssh 3.4_p1 man page. to enable
  ssh-askpass, keychain now requires that the ssh_askpass var be set to point
  to your askpass program.

* keychain 2.0.1 (24 Aug 2002)

  24 Aug 2002; "--help" fixes; the keychain files were listed as sh-${HOSTNAME}
  rather than ${HOSTNAME}-sh. Now consistent with the actual program. Thanks to
  Christian Plessl <plessl@tik.ee.ethz.ch>, others for reporting this issue.

  24 Aug 2002; cycloon <cycloon@linux-de.org>: "If you add < /dev/null when
  adding the missingkeys via "ssh-add ${missingkeys}" (at line 454 of version
  2.0) so that it reads: "ssh-add ${missingkeys} < /dev/null" then users can
  use program like x11-ssh-askpass in xfree to type in their passphrase. It
  then still works for users on shell, depending if $DISPLAY is set." Added. 
  
  24 Aug 2002; A fix to calling "tail" that *should* fix things for Tru64 Unix;
  unfortunately, I have no way to test but the solution should be portable to
  all other flavors of systems. Thanks to Mark Scarborough
  <Mark.Scarborough@broadwing.com> for reporting the issue.
  
  24 Aug 2002; Changed around the psopts detection stuff so that "-x -u $me f"
  is used; this is needed on MacOS X. Thanks to Brian Bergstrand
  <brian@classicalguitar.net>, others for reporting this issue.

* keychain 2.0 (17 Aug 2002)

  17 Aug 2002; (Many submitters): A fix for keychain when running on HP-UX
  10.20.
  
  17 Aug 2002; Patrice DUMAS - DOCT <dumas@centre-cired.fr>: Now perform help
  early on to avoid unnecessary processing. Also added --dir option to allow
  keychain to look in an alternate location for the .keychain directory (use
  like this: "keychain --dir /var/foo")
 
  17 Aug 2002; Martial MICHEL <martial@users.sourceforge.net>: Martial also
  suggested moving help processing to earlier in the script. He also submitted
  a patch to place .ssh-agent-* files in a ~/.keychain/ directory, which makes
  sense particularly for NFS users so I integrated the concept into the code.
 
  17 Aug 2002; Fred Carter <fred.carter@amberpoint.com>: Cygwin fix to use
  proper "ps" options.

  17 Aug 2002; Adrian Howard <adrianh@quietstars.com>: patch so that lockfile
  gets removed even if --noask is specified.

  17 Aug 2002; Mario Wolff <wolff@voll.prima.de>: Replaced an awk dependency
  with a shell construct for improved performance.

  17 Aug 2002; Marcus Stoegbauer <marcus@grmpf.org>, Dmitry Frolov
  <frolov@riss-telecom.ru>: I (Daniel Robbins) solved problems reported by
  Marcus and Dmitry (mis-parsed command line issues) by following Dmitry's good
  suggestion of performing argument parsing all at once at the top of the
  script.

  17 Aug 2002; Brian W. Curry <truth@bcurry.cjb.net>: Added commercial SSH2
  client support; improved output readability by initializing myfail=0;
  integrated Cygwin support into the main keychain script; improved Cygwin
  support by setting "trap" appropriately. Thanks Brian!

* keychain 1.9 (04 Mar 2002)

  04 Mar 2002; changed license from "GPL, v2 or later" to "GPL v2".
  
  04 Mar 2002; added "keychain.cygwin" for Cygwin systems.  It may be time to
  follow this pattern and start building separate, optimized scripts for each
  platform so they don't get too sluggish.  Maybe I could use a C preprocessor
  for this.
  
  06 Dec 2001; several people: Solaris doesn't like '-e' comparisons; switched
  to '-f'

* keychain 1.8 (29 Nov 2001)

  29 Nov 2001; Philip Hallstrom (philip@adhesivemedia.com) Added a "--local"
  option for removing the ${HOSTNAME} from the various files that keychain
  creates.  Handy for non-NFS users.
  
  29 Nov 2001; Aron Griffis (agriffis@gentoo.org) Using the Bourne shell "type"
  builtin rather than using the external "which" command.  Should make things a
  lot more robust and slightly faster.
  
  09 Nov 2001; Mike Briseno (mike@radik.com) Solaris' "which" command outputs
  "no lockfile in..." to stdout rather than stderr.  A one-line fix (test the
  error condition) has been applied.

  09 Nov 2001; lockfile settings tweak

  09 Nov 2001; Rewrote how keychain detects failed passphrase attempts.  If you
  stop making progress providing valid passphrases, it's three strikes and
  you're out.

  09 Nov 2001; Constantine P. Sapuntzakis (csapuntz@stanford.edu) Some private
  keys can't be "ssh-keygen -l -f"'d; this patch causes keychain to look for
  the corresponding public key if the private key doesn't work.  Thanks
  Constantine!

  09 Nov 2001; Victor Leitman (vleitman@yahoo.com) CYAN color misdefined;
  fixed.
  
  27 Oct 2001; Brian Wellington (bwelling@xbill.org) A "quiet mode" (--quiet)
  fix; I missed an "echo".
  
  27 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org) Missed another "kill -9"; it's
  now gone.

* keychain 1.7 (21 Oct 2001) 
 
  21 Oct 2001; Frederic Gobry (frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch) Frederic suggested
  using procmail's lockfile to serialize the execution of critical parts of
  keychain, thus avoiding multiple ssh-agent processes being started if you
  happen to have multiple xterms open automatically when you log in.
  Initially, I didn't think I could add this, since systems may not have the
  lockfile command; however, keychain will now auto-detect whether lockfile is
  installed; if it is, keychain will automatically use it, thus preventing
  multiple ssh-agent processes from being spawned. 
  
  21 Oct 2001; Raymond Wu (ursus@usa.net): --nocolor test is no longer inside
  the test for whether "echo -e" works.  According to Raymond, this works
  optimally on his Solaris box.
  
  21 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org): No longer "kill -9" our
  ssh-agent processes. SIGTERM should be sufficient and will allow ssh-agent to
  clean up after itself (this reverses a previously-applied patch).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no): Added argument "--quiet |
  -q" to make the program less intrusive to the user; with it, only error and
  interactive messages will appear.
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no): Changed the format of some
  arguments to bring them more in line with common *nix programs: added "-h" as
  alias for "--help"; added "-k" as alias for "--stop"

  21 Oct 2001; Mark Stosberg (mark@summersault.com): $pidf to "$pidf" fixes to
  allow keychain to work with paths that include spaces (for Darwin and MacOS X
  in particular).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Jonathan Wakely (redi@redi.uklinux.net): Small patch to convert
  "echo -n -e" to "echo -e "\c"" for FreeBSD compatibility.

* keychain 1.6 (15 Oct 2001)

  13 Oct 2001; Ralf Horstmann (ralf.horstmann@webwasher.com): Add /usr/ucb to
  path for Solaris systems.
  
  11 Oct 2001; Idea from Joe Reid (jreid@vnet.net): Try to add multiple keys
  using ssh-add; avoid typing in identical passphrases more than once.  Good
  idea!

*keychain 1.5 (21 Sep 2001)

  21 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com): misc. compatibility, signal
  handling, cleanup fixes
  
  21 Sep 2001; "ps" test to find the right one for your OS.

  20 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): "grep [s]sh-agent" to "grep
  [s]sh-agent" (zsh fix)

*keychain 1.4 (20 Sep 2001)

  20 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com): "touch $foo" to ">$foo"
  optimization and other "don't fork" fixes.  Converted ${foo#--} to a case
  statement for Solaris sh compatibility.

  20 Sep 2001; Try an alternate "ps" syntax if our default one fails.  This
  should give us Solaris and IRIX (sysV) compatibility without breaking BSD.

  20 Sep 2001; Hans Peter Verne (h.p.verne@usit.uio.no); "echo -e" to "echo $E"
  (for IRIX compatibility with --nocolor), optimization of grep ("grep
  [s]sh-agent")
  
  17 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): Various fixes: trap signal 2
  if signal INT not supported (NetBSD); handle invalid keys correctly; ancient
  version of ash didn't support ~, so using $HOME; correct zsh instruction;
  minor cleanups

*keychain 1.3 (12 Sep 2001)
  
  12 Sep 2001; Minor color changes; the cyan was hard to read on xterm-colored
  terms so it was switched to bold.  Additional --help text added.
  
  10 Sep 2001; We now use .ssh-agent-[hostname] instead of .ssh-agent.  We now
  create a .ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] file that can be sourced by csh-compatible
  shells.  We also now kill all our existing ssh-agent processes before
  starting a new one.

  10 Sep 2001; Robert R. Wal (rrw@hell.pl): Very nice NFS fixes, colorization
  fixes, tcsh redirect -> grep -v fix.  Thanks go out to others who sent me
  similar patches.

  10 Sep 2001; Johann Visagie (johann@egenetics.com): "source" to "."
  shell-compatibility fixes.  Thanks for the FreeBSD port.

  10 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): rm -f $pidf after stopping
  ssh-agent fix

*keychain 1.2 

  09 Sep 2001; README updates to reflect new changes.
  
  09 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): bash 1/zsh/sh compatibility;
  now only tries to kill *your* ssh-agent processes, version fix, .ssh-agent
  file creation error detection.  Thanks! 

*keychain 1.1; fixes for calling "pidof"; README; ChangeLog

  07 Sep 2001; Addition of README stating that keychain requires bash 2.0 or
  greater, as well as quick install directions and web URL.

  07 Sep 2001; Explicitly added /sbin and /usr/sbin to path, and then called
  "pidof".  I think that this is a bit more robust.
  
  06 Sep 2001; from John Ellson (ellson@lucent.com): "pidof" changed to
  "/sbin/pidof", since it's probably not in $PATH
 
  06 Sep 2001; New ChangeLog! :)

*keychain 1.0; initial release (Aug 2001)
