* keychain 2.0.3 (06 Apr 2003)
  06 Apr 2003; Seth Chandler <sethbc@gentoo.org>; 
  Added keychain man page, fixed bugs with displaying colors for keychain 
  --help.  Also added a $grepopts to fix the grepping for a pid on cygwin

* keychain 2.0.2 (26 Aug 2002)

  26 Aug 2002; the Tru64 fix didn't work; it was being caused by "trap - foo"
  rather than "tail +2 -". Now really fixed.

  26 Aug 2002; fixed "ssh-add" call to only redirect stdin (thus enabling
  ssh-askpass) if ssh_askpass happens to be set; this is to work around a bug
  in openssh were redirecting stdin will enable ssh-askpass even if ssh_askpass
  isn't set, which contradicts the openssh 3.4_p1 man page. to enable
  ssh-askpass, keychain now requires that the ssh_askpass var be set to point
  to your askpass program.

* keychain 2.0.1 (24 Aug 2002)

  24 Aug 2002; "--help" fixes; the keychain files were listed as sh-${HOSTNAME}
  rather than ${HOSTNAME}-sh. Now consistent with the actual program. Thanks to
  Christian Plessl <plessl@tik.ee.ethz.ch>, others for reporting this issue.

  24 Aug 2002; cycloon <cycloon@linux-de.org>: "If you add < /dev/null when
  adding the missingkeys via "ssh-add ${missingkeys}" (at line 454 of version
  2.0) so that it reads: "ssh-add ${missingkeys} < /dev/null" then users can
  use program like x11-ssh-askpass in xfree to type in their passphrase. It
  then still works for users on shell, depending if $DISPLAY is set." Added. 
  
  24 Aug 2002; A fix to calling "tail" that *should* fix things for Tru64 Unix;
  unfortunately, I have no way to test but the solution should be portable to
  all other flavors of systems. Thanks to Mark Scarborough
  <Mark.Scarborough@broadwing.com> for reporting the issue.
  
  24 Aug 2002; Changed around the psopts detection stuff so that "-x -u $me f"
  is used; this is needed on MacOS X. Thanks to Brian Bergstrand
  <brian@classicalguitar.net>, others for reporting this issue.

* keychain 2.0 (17 Aug 2002)

  17 Aug 2002; (Many submitters): A fix for keychain when running on HP-UX
  10.20.
  
  17 Aug 2002; Patrice DUMAS - DOCT <dumas@centre-cired.fr>: Now perform help
  early on to avoid unnecessary processing. Also added --dir option to allow
  keychain to look in an alternate location for the .keychain directory (use
  like this: "keychain --dir /var/foo")
 
  17 Aug 2002; Martial MICHEL <martial@users.sourceforge.net>: Martial also
  suggested moving help processing to earlier in the script. He also submitted
  a patch to place .ssh-agent-* files in a ~/.keychain/ directory, which makes
  sense particularly for NFS users so I integrated the concept into the code.
 
  17 Aug 2002; Fred Carter <fred.carter@amberpoint.com>: Cygwin fix to use
  proper "ps" options.

  17 Aug 2002; Adrian Howard <adrianh@quietstars.com>: patch so that lockfile
  gets removed even if --noask is specified.

  17 Aug 2002; Mario Wolff <wolff@voll.prima.de>: Replaced an awk dependency
  with a shell construct for improved performance.

  17 Aug 2002; Marcus Stoegbauer <marcus@grmpf.org>, Dmitry Frolov
  <frolov@riss-telecom.ru>: I (Daniel Robbins) solved problems reported by
  Marcus and Dmitry (mis-parsed command line issues) by following Dmitry's good
  suggestion of performing argument parsing all at once at the top of the
  script.

  17 Aug 2002; Brian W. Curry <truth@bcurry.cjb.net>: Added commercial SSH2
  client support; improved output readability by initializing myfail=0;
  integrated Cygwin support into the main keychain script; improved Cygwin
  support by setting "trap" appropriately. Thanks Brian!

* keychain 1.9 (04 Mar 2002)

  04 Mar 2002; changed license from "GPL, v2 or later" to "GPL v2".
  
  04 Mar 2002; added "keychain.cygwin" for Cygwin systems.  It may be time to
  follow this pattern and start building separate, optimized scripts for each
  platform so they don't get too sluggish.  Maybe I could use a C preprocessor
  for this.
  
  06 Dec 2001; several people: Solaris doesn't like '-e' comparisons; switched
  to '-f'

* keychain 1.8 (29 Nov 2001)

  29 Nov 2001; Philip Hallstrom (philip@adhesivemedia.com) Added a "--local"
  option for removing the ${HOSTNAME} from the various files that keychain
  creates.  Handy for non-NFS users.
  
  29 Nov 2001; Aron Griffis (agriffis@gentoo.org) Using the Bourne shell "type"
  builtin rather than using the external "which" command.  Should make things a
  lot more robust and slightly faster.
  
  09 Nov 2001; Mike Briseno (mike@radik.com) Solaris' "which" command outputs
  "no lockfile in..." to stdout rather than stderr.  A one-line fix (test the
  error condition) has been applied.

  09 Nov 2001; lockfile settings tweak

  09 Nov 2001; Rewrote how keychain detects failed passphrase attempts.  If you
  stop making progress providing valid passphrases, it's three strikes and
  you're out.

  09 Nov 2001; Constantine P. Sapuntzakis (csapuntz@stanford.edu) Some private
  keys can't be "ssh-keygen -l -f"'d; this patch causes keychain to look for
  the corresponding public key if the private key doesn't work.  Thanks
  Constantine!

  09 Nov 2001; Victor Leitman (vleitman@yahoo.com) CYAN color misdefined;
  fixed.
  
  27 Oct 2001; Brian Wellington (bwelling@xbill.org) A "quiet mode" (--quiet)
  fix; I missed an "echo".
  
  27 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org) Missed another "kill -9"; it's
  now gone.

* keychain 1.7 (21 Oct 2001) 
 
  21 Oct 2001; Frederic Gobry (frederic.gobry@smartdata.ch) Frederic suggested
  using procmail's lockfile to serialize the execution of critical parts of
  keychain, thus avoiding multiple ssh-agent processes being started if you
  happen to have multiple xterms open automatically when you log in.
  Initially, I didn't think I could add this, since systems may not have the
  lockfile command; however, keychain will now auto-detect whether lockfile is
  installed; if it is, keychain will automatically use it, thus preventing
  multiple ssh-agent processes from being spawned. 
  
  21 Oct 2001; Raymond Wu (ursus@usa.net): --nocolor test is no longer inside
  the test for whether "echo -e" works.  According to Raymond, this works
  optimally on his Solaris box.
  
  21 Oct 2001; J.A. Neitzel (jan@belvento.org): No longer "kill -9" our
  ssh-agent processes. SIGTERM should be sufficient and will allow ssh-agent to
  clean up after itself (this reverses a previously-applied patch).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no): Added argument "--quiet |
  -q" to make the program less intrusive to the user; with it, only error and
  interactive messages will appear.
  
  21 Oct 2001; Thomas Finneid (tfinneid@online.no): Changed the format of some
  arguments to bring them more in line with common *nix programs: added "-h" as
  alias for "--help"; added "-k" as alias for "--stop"

  21 Oct 2001; Mark Stosberg (mark@summersault.com): $pidf to "$pidf" fixes to
  allow keychain to work with paths that include spaces (for Darwin and MacOS X
  in particular).
  
  21 Oct 2001; Jonathan Wakely (redi@redi.uklinux.net): Small patch to convert
  "echo -n -e" to "echo -e "\c"" for FreeBSD compatibility.

* keychain 1.6 (15 Oct 2001)

  13 Oct 2001; Ralf Horstmann (ralf.horstmann@webwasher.com): Add /usr/ucb to
  path for Solaris systems.
  
  11 Oct 2001; Idea from Joe Reid (jreid@vnet.net): Try to add multiple keys
  using ssh-add; avoid typing in identical passphrases more than once.  Good
  idea!

*keychain 1.5 (21 Sep 2001)

  21 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com): misc. compatibility, signal
  handling, cleanup fixes
  
  21 Sep 2001; "ps" test to find the right one for your OS.

  20 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): "grep [s]sh-agent" to "grep
  [s]sh-agent" (zsh fix)

*keychain 1.4 (20 Sep 2001)

  20 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com): "touch $foo" to ">$foo"
  optimization and other "don't fork" fixes.  Converted ${foo#--} to a case
  statement for Solaris sh compatibility.

  20 Sep 2001; Try an alternate "ps" syntax if our default one fails.  This
  should give us Solaris and IRIX (sysV) compatibility without breaking BSD.

  20 Sep 2001; Hans Peter Verne (h.p.verne@usit.uio.no); "echo -e" to "echo $E"
  (for IRIX compatibility with --nocolor), optimization of grep ("grep
  [s]sh-agent")
  
  17 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): Various fixes: trap signal 2
  if signal INT not supported (NetBSD); handle invalid keys correctly; ancient
  version of ash didn't support ~, so using $HOME; correct zsh instruction;
  minor cleanups

*keychain 1.3 (12 Sep 2001)
  
  12 Sep 2001; Minor color changes; the cyan was hard to read on xterm-colored
  terms so it was switched to bold.  Additional --help text added.
  
  10 Sep 2001; We now use .ssh-agent-[hostname] instead of .ssh-agent.  We now
  create a .ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] file that can be sourced by csh-compatible
  shells.  We also now kill all our existing ssh-agent processes before
  starting a new one.

  10 Sep 2001; Robert R. Wal (rrw@hell.pl): Very nice NFS fixes, colorization
  fixes, tcsh redirect -> grep -v fix.  Thanks go out to others who sent me
  similar patches.

  10 Sep 2001; Johann Visagie (johann@egenetics.com): "source" to "."
  shell-compatibility fixes.  Thanks for the FreeBSD port.

  10 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): rm -f $pidf after stopping
  ssh-agent fix

*keychain 1.2 

  09 Sep 2001; README updates to reflect new changes.
  
  09 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi): bash 1/zsh/sh compatibility;
  now only tries to kill *your* ssh-agent processes, version fix, .ssh-agent
  file creation error detection.  Thanks! 

*keychain 1.1; fixes for calling "pidof"; README; ChangeLog

  07 Sep 2001; Addition of README stating that keychain requires bash 2.0 or
  greater, as well as quick install directions and web URL.

  07 Sep 2001; Explicitly added /sbin and /usr/sbin to path, and then called
  "pidof".  I think that this is a bit more robust.
  
  06 Sep 2001; from John Ellson (ellson@lucent.com): "pidof" changed to
  "/sbin/pidof", since it's probably not in $PATH
 
  06 Sep 2001; New ChangeLog! :)

*keychain 1.0; initial release (Aug 2001)
